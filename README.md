## Why This Exists

Automotive software engineering is one of the most complex and regulated domains in the world. Engineers juggle **ISO 26262 functional safety**, **AUTOSAR architectures**, **MISRA compliance**, **cybersecurity standards**, and **real-time embedded constraints** -- all while shipping on aggressive timelines.

**Automotive Claude Code Agents** turns Claude Code into a domain-expert copilot that understands the automotive stack from silicon to cloud. Instead of spending hours looking up ASIL decomposition rules or AUTOSAR naming conventions, you get instant, standards-compliant guidance woven directly into your development workflow.

One install. Zero config. Your existing workspace stays untouched.

```
Before:  "How do I structure an FMEA for this BMS module?" -> 2 hours of research
After:   claude "Generate FMEA for overcurrent protection in ASIL-D BMS" -> 2 minutes
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jenechina/automotive-claude-code-agents.git
cd automotive-claude-code-agents

# 2. Preview what will be installed (no changes made)
./install.sh --dry-run

# 3. Install into your existing ~/.claude workspace
./install.sh

# 4. Start using it immediately
claude "Help me design an AUTOSAR Adaptive service for camera fusion"
```

That's it. Your existing Claude Code workspace (settings, agents, hooks) is **never modified**. All automotive content is namespaced with an `automotive-` prefix and tracked in a manifest for clean removal.

```bash
# Check what's installed
./install.sh --status

# Clean removal (only removes automotive components)
./install.sh --uninstall
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Use an automotive agent
claude "Using automotive-adas-perception-engineer, design a LiDAR point cloud pipeline"

# Run an automotive command
/automotive adas-camera-calibrate

# Get safety guidance
claude "Review this C function for ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance"

# Generate AUTOSAR artifacts
/automotive autosar-swc-scaffold
```

  install.sh           Append-safe installer (the only file you run)
```

---

## Optional: Settings Integration

The installer generates `~/.claude/automotive-settings-snippet.json` with recommended hooks for MISRA checking, safety review prompts, and secret scanning. To activate:

```bash
# Option 1: Let Claude merge it for you
claude "Merge automotive-settings-snippet.json into my settings.json"

# Option 2: Review and manually copy desired hooks
cat ~/.claude/automotive-settings-snippet.json
```

This step is entirely optional. All skills, agents, and commands work without it.

---

## Build & Test

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Lint Python code
ruff check tools/ scripts/

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=tools --cov-report=html tests/

# Validate skill/agent YAML structure
python -m pytest tests/test_skills.py tests/test_agents.py
```
